## **Project Description: AgroTrack**

**AgroTrack** is a comprehensive, one-stop platform that connects farmers to all aspects of their farming cycle. It integrates services for retailing, leasing, and selling produce, allowing farmers to easily access local mandis and aggregators. AgroTrack also facilitates **Agri Credit**, enabling farmers to purchase or lease farm machinery, and provides access to local vendors for plantation supplies, all within the app.

The platform ensures that farmers can manage farm activities, personal expenses, and transactions effortlessly. With expert advice from nearby agricultural universities and real-time access to field monitoring, crop health, and irrigation management, AgroTrack helps farmers make informed decisions for better productivity and sustainability. By streamlining farming operations and offering easy access to financing and resources, AgroTrack empowers farmers to grow their businesses more efficiently.
